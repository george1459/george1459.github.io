Hi there! I am Shicheng Liu, fourth-year CS Ph.D. at Stanford advised by [Prof. Monica S. Lam](https://suif.stanford.edu/~lam/) at [Stanford Open Virtual Assistant Lab (OVAL)](https://oval.cs.stanford.edu/) and [Stanford NLP Group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/). I focus on real-life, practical NLP problems, often drawing perspectives from computer systems and programming languages. My recent research focuses on knowledge agents with LLMs, aiming to enable domain-independent approaches that effectively retrieve and navigate different sources of knowledge, including structured, unstructured, and hybrid (combination of structured and unstructured data) sources.

During summer 2025, I was an AI research intern at Meta, working with [Kai Sun](https://www.kaisun.org/), [Scott Yih](https://scottyih.org/), and [Luna Dong](https://lunadong.com/) on RL for knowledge extraction.

I am grateful to be supported by the [2025-2026 IBM PhD Fellowship Award](www.research.ibm.com/university/awards/fellowships).
