Hi there! I am Shicheng (George) Liu, third-year CS Ph.D. at Stanford. I am currently advised by [Prof. Monica S. Lam](https://suif.stanford.edu/~lam/) at [Stanford Open Virtual Assistant Lab (OVAL)](https://oval.cs.stanford.edu/). I focus on real-life, practical NLP problems, often drawing perspectives from computer systems and programming languages. My recent research focuses on knowledge agents with LLMs, aiming to enable domain-independent approaches that effectively retrieve and navigate different sources of knowledge, including structured, unstructured, and hybrid (combination of structured and unstructured data) sources.
