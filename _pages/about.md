Hi there! I am Shicheng (George) Liu, second-year CS Ph.D. at Stanford. I am currently advised by [Prof. Monica S. Lam](https://suif.stanford.edu/~lam/) at [Stanford Open Virtual Assistant Lab (OVAL)](https://oval.cs.stanford.edu/), working on conversational knowledge agents with Large Language Models (LLMs).

I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing, Programming Languages, Software Engineering, and Systems.

Previously, I was an undergrad at The University of Chicago double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in Physics. While at UChicago, I worked with [Prof. Shan Lu](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~shanlu/) on understanding how Machine Learning (ML) cloud APIs are used in the wild and proposed the first systematic testing framework for ML cloud APIs.
