Hi there! I am Shicheng (George) Liu. I will be joining Stanford CS Ph.D. program in 2022, initially advised by [Prof. Monica Lam](https://suif.stanford.edu/~lam/).

I am currently a final-year undergrad at The University of Chicago double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in Physics. I am broadly interested in Programming Languages, Software Engineering, and Systems. While at UChicago, I worked with [Prof. Shan Lu](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~shanlu/) (whose help and guidance I cannot thank enough) and [Chengcheng Wan](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~cwan/) on a series of Machine Learning (ML) API studies. We conducted the first empirical study on understanding how such ML APIs are used by developers and proposed the first systematic testing framework for such APIs.
